Filtering = common defense against shells
Client-side & Server-side
#
Client-side: commonly uses JavaScript, run on the client's browser and as such directly on your machine

Server-side: .php - run on the Web Server, much more secure, the most common
also runs Python or C#
#
-Create a PAYLOAD to bypass the filter
#
#
Types of FILTERING:
-Extension validation
checks file extensions, blacklist/whitelist Windows uses it to determine the file type
Unix based are a little different 
.php .html .xml .xmls .httphp
-File Type validation
contents of a file, acceptable to download?
MIME | in the header of the request <type>/<subtype> or in the case of an upload of cat.jpeg then it will be image/jpeg
Unix systems use MAGIC NUMBERS to determine the file type instead, string of numbers in the file to determine its type, like
a PNG file would have these bytes at the very top of the file: 89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A
-File lenght filtering
-File Content filtering
more complex it will scan the file to check if mime and magic numbers are not being spoofed
#
example of MIME can be also text/csv
when uploading a csv file or text/docx
